# dotfiles
core, essential dotfiles and some other stuff

notes:
  - my vim plugin manager is vim-plug
  - my alternative vim theme w/ more colors is morhetz/gruvbox
  - i trigger the applescripts in mac-scripts with raycast

i now keep this stuff on [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~mmarat01/dotfiles).
